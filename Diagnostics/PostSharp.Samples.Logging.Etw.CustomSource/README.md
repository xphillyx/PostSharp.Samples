This example demonstrates how to configure customize the name and GUID of the ETW event source.

The custom log source is implemented in the `MyEventSource` class. This class must fulfill the following requirements:

* Inherit the `PostSharpEventSource` class 
* Be annotated with the `EventSource` and `Guid` custom attributes.
* Contain a set of predefined methods annotated with an `Event` custom attribute. You can change the method name or
  any parameter of the `Event` custom attribute, but you can change nor the `eventId` parameter and nor the
  signature of the method for this specific event. These methods exist for the sole purpose of defining the
  event metadata. They are never invoked directly.


An instance of the new event source class is passed to the constructor of `EventSourceLoggingBackend`.


## Viewing the log

To view the log produced by this example, you need to attach a log collector:

1. Download PerfView from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=28567.

2. Execute: perfview.exe collect -OnlyProviders:*MyEventSource

3. Execute this program.

4. In PerfView, click 'Stop collecting', then in the PerfView tree view click 'PerfViewData.etl.zip' and finally 'Events'.
